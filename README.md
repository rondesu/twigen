# Twitter Account Creation Bot

## Overview
This project is a Python3-based automation tool designed to automate the process of creating Twitter (formerly known as X) accounts. It integrates external solvers, specifically for Arkose Labs' FunCaptcha, using solutions such as CapSolver and others, to navigate through the verification processes efficiently.
The tool utilizes temporary email addresses to register new accounts, ensuring a streamlined creation process without the need for personal email involvement.

## Features
Automated Twitter Account Creation: Streamlines the process of setting up new Twitter accounts.
FunCaptcha Resolution: Incorporates external solver services to bypass Arkose Labs' FunCaptcha challenges.
Temporary Email Usage: Utilizes disposable email services for account registration to maintain privacy and convenience.
Python3 Support: Built entirely in Python3, leveraging its robust libraries and frameworks for efficient automation.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
External solver service subscription (e.g., CapSolver)
Access to a service providing temporary email addresses
